# HackingWithSwiftLearning
A Repository that includes the projects I've done from [Paul Hudson's Hacking With Swift "100 Days of Swift"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100).

The purpose is learning Swift and iOS in general.

List of projects (so far):
1. Storm Viewer: a small app that shows images when clicked.
2. Flag Game: a small game that quiz users on country flags.
3. A technique project (which is just an improvement on Project 1)
4. A web browser app: an app that open browsers of the website users want to see (this is a project I struggled with the most so far, but the end result was rewarding!)
5. Scramble Word Game: a small game where users are challenged to put in anagrams of a word given.
