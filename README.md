# HackingWithSwiftLearning
A Repository that includes the projects I've done from [Paul Hudson's Hacking With Swift "100 Days of Swift"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100).

The purpose is learning Swift and iOS in general.

List of projects (so far):
1. Storm Viewer: a small app that shows images when clicked.
2. Flag Game: a small game that quiz users on country flags.
3. A technique project (which is just an improvement on Project 1)
4. A web browser app: an app that open browsers of the website users want to see (this is a project I struggled with the most so far, but the end result was rewarding!)
5. Scramble Word Game: a small game where users are challenged to put in anagrams of a word given.
6. A technique project which were split into 6a and 6b: 6a is improving on Project 2 and 6b is all about learning Auto Layout.
7. Whitehouse Petitions: a small app in which I pulled JSON data from the Whitehouse website and display as table.
8. Swiftly Game: a word connection game in which I learnt how to code the UI 100% programmatically.
9. Grand Central Dispatch: a technique project to apply Grand Central Dispatch framework into project 7. Learnt about concurrency and multithreading.
10. Names to Faces: an app where users can add pictures and names of people they want to learn their names. Learnt about UICollectionView and UIImagePicker.
